# Uniboard

## Description
`Uniboard` is a cross-device universal clipboard and file-sharing platform made with `Next.js` and `Go`. It uses a `MySQL` database from `Planetscale` to store messages and users and `AWS S3` for file storage.
## TODO
- [ ] Planetscale schema for fields:
	- created_at
	- modified_at
- [ ] NewUser method integrate instead of decoding directly to struct
